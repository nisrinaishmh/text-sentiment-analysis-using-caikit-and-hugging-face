# text-sentiment-analysis-using-caikit-and-hugging-face
Configured the Caikit runtime to load and run a Hugging Face text sentiment analysis model. Then deployed a client application on the runtime that used the Caikit API to query the Hugging Face model for sentiment analysis on text strings. The model response included the sentiment analysis and a confidence score for each sample.
